This is my Profile Website. I had made it for WD4E specialization by University of Michigan hosted on Coursera. It is pretty basic but a good website. Improvements are being made from time to time.
NOte that most of the JS is inside the HTML files. Also, I was trying to make one CSS file for all HTML pages. Please help if possible.
